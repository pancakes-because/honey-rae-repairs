// added a button called "emergency only" in our jsx

/* updated code after making a ternary statement out of the button code */ 

// now, we're adding a "show all" button to display all tickets for employees
// this is to let employees click between the "emergency only" and "show all" buttons, so they can switch between seeing emergency tickets only and seeing their full ticket list
// we can create another button and ternnary statement for this
// reminder, "setEmergency(false)" is the state where see emergency tickets only when the "emergency only" button is clicked
// so to see all tickets when the "show all" button is cilcked, we can set the state as "setEmergency(false)" 
// since we now have two button components, we need to put all of the button code in its own fragment; react rule 

// above the list of tickes, we're making a  "create ticket" button that ONLY customers can see 
// when the customer clicks it, the navigate feature from react-router-dom will route them to a new route in the browser
// when the customer clicks it, we are changing the route to "/ticket/create" 
// this will be a new page with a form that creates a ticket in the ticket list view; the form input fields are in "TicketForm.js"
// after they fill out the form, they will be routed back to the ticket list to see the new ticket they just made 

// now, we want to create a "open tickets" button that can ONLY be seen by customers 
// this should show service tickets that don't have a "dateCompleted" value
// so we create a fragment in th jsx to group this with the "create ticket" button
// similar to employees, where we set a state variable and component for emergency and non-emergency tickets, we'll create another state variable for open and closed tickets.
// the initial state variable is "openOnly" and the setter function to change the state is "updateOpenOnly"; see above 
// down here in the jsx, we'll set updateOpenOnly to "true" when the button is clicked, so it shows open tickets like we want.
// and because a state variable is changing when the button is clicked, we need to observe the state variable changing, so we need a useEffect() whose job it is is to observe state
// we made the useEffect, so we're all set here! 

// now, we want to create a "all my tickets" button to show all the customer's tickets and set the state variable back to false
// so we add this in the jsx. reminder, only open tickets should be shown when updateOpenOnly is "true"
// to see all tickets, we can set updateOpenOnly to "false"
// now we go back and update the useEffect that was observing "updateOnly" with an else condition
// reminder, we the "myTickets" variable is storing the customer's tickets, so we can use this with "setFiltered" to show that 
// so we can steal some of the login from the first useEffect basically

// now, we're going to share state between two components with props (which are like arguments to functions)
// when there are two sibling components, they cannot share state. 
// you have to make a parent component that contains both of them, and then both child components share state between them. 
// we're going to do this with adding a search input field for tickets for employees ONLY. 
// this will let the employee type in the description of ticket and receive a list of tickets matching what they typed in.
// so we need to create a parent component containing both the input field and the list of tickets.
// ***so create a new component or module called "TicketSearch.js"***
