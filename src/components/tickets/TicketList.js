// react has a function named useState() to store the state in a component.
// the function returns an array. 
// "tickets" has a value of an empty array. it holds the intial state value at index 0
// "setTickets" has a value of a function. this function modifies the state at index 1.

// react also provides a function named useEffect() to observe state. 
// it allows you to observe state and run some instructions when state changes.
// since the useState function performs the first change in state, you can observe that.

// but when the state changes, when the user logs in, the tickets are filtered 
// they are filtered to either show all tickets for employees
// or to show the customer's own tickets for the customer 

// in dev tools, we were getting an error saying, "Each child in a list should have a unique key prop"
// to fix this, we added key={`ticket--${ticket.id}`}, so each ticket has it's id attached to it 

// added a button called "emergency only" in our jsx 
// this will be used when employees want to see emergency tickets only 
// we want to change the state to "true" when the button is clicked, so we have a onClick function for this 
// we can see this change using dev tools 

// right now, the "emergency only" button displays for both employees and customers 
// we want to change this, so that the button displays for employees ONLY 
// to do this, we copied the code for the button and made ternary statement out of it 
// so if an employee logs in, honeyUserObject.staff being "truthy" or true, then show the button. 
// otherwise, for customers, print an empty string which equals to nothing -- so no button shows for customers
